# API Gateway with HTTP

For this we use ubuntu server running Apache

A *VPC Link is created along with an HTTP API Gateway. A `/` route is created and sent to a private resource via VPC Link.

> \* VPC links enable you to create private integrations that connect your HTTP API routes to private resources in a VPC, such as Application Load Balancers or Amazon ECS container-based applications.
